# FLL-Apps-2020

Source code for a series of Android and iOS apps designed for FLL teams. Contains the Web App and Xcode and Android Studio projects. Large portions of the code depend on the ionic framework and nodejs (see https://ionicframework.com/docs). However, most of it will properly render with a python http server: `python3 -m http.server`.

For older apps from past seasons (with versions that do not require nodejs), see https://github.com/sanjayseshan/FLL-Apps
